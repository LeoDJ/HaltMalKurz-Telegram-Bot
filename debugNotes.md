This will enable inline queries for your bot. https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline. Use /empty to disable.

To enable inline mode, please send me the placeholder message for queries to your bot. People will see this placeholder whenever they type @kaenguruBot in the message field – in any chat. Tell them what they can get from your bot (e.g., Search GIFs...).
